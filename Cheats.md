title: Cheat and debug keys
toc: true
---

Following is a list of cheats you can use during play or development of
GemRB.

Most of them do the same thing as the **[original
cheats](https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/appendices/clua/bg2.htm)**,
so we will list here only the differences and important ones.

Cheat keys are enabled by default. 

## Pop-up console

You can toggle the console with the **Ctrl+Space** key combination, which will
open or close it respectively at the top of the screen. It accepts all
[GUIScript commands](GUIScript/Functions.md)  and python expressions. The GemRB
module is already imported, so it's enough to call `GameSetPartyGold(1000)`
instead of `GemRB.GameSetPartyGold(1000)`.

Additionally, a few common functions have [shorthands defined](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/gemrb/GUIScripts/Console.py#L40),
so things can be done faster (eg. `mta()` for `MoveToArea()`).

When you want to see the output of functions, remember to `print` it. You can also redirect
the log to also display in the game message window with `MessageWindowDebug(5)`.
