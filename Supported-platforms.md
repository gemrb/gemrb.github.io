title: Supported platforms
---

GemRB runs on various software and hardware platforms, so here is a list
of various ports and their status. The biggest hurdle in making GemRB
work is usually making its dependencies work (SDL, Python, zlib). You
can watch [videos](https://gemrb.github.io/Media#videos) or see some
[screenshots](https://gemrb.github.io/Media) from these
platforms on our website.
