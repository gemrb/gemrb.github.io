title: Icewind Dale 2 is now completable!
author: Jaka Kranjc

For the first time in GemRB history, an Icewind Dale 2 game has been successfully
**played from start to finish**. It was a solo run with some combat cheating to make it
faster, but the main news is that there are no more in-game scripting related blockers.
Scripting is highlighted, since that is what thwarted all previous attempts.

Brave explorers can try the development builds, but do note: while the game is completable,
**it is not polished yet**. The actionbar can't be customized, there is a severe spell learning
problem for some classes, weapon sets are not working well, a few spells have projectile
problems, there are a few combat bugs [etc](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/labels/game%3A%20iwd2).

The nastiest remaining problems will be addressed before the next official release. So
**unless you want to [contribute to making the experience better](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), it's best if you wait
until then**.
