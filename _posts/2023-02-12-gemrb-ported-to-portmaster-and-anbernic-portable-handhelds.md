GemRB, the popular open-source game engine, has been successfully ported to PortMaster and
is now compatible with a wide range of embedded portable handheld devices, including the
Anbernic RG351V/MP, RG353P/V/M, and RG552. This exciting development means that classic
role-playing games such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment can now be
played on-the-go more easily, providing gamers with an immersive and convenient gaming experience.

The porting process was quick and required only minimal changes to get GemRB running
smoothly on the operating systems that use PortMaster. This was made possible due to
the high compatibility and robust architecture of GemRB, which integrate seamlessly
with the hardware and software of the handheld devices.

The PortMaster port was contributed by [Kloptops](https://github.com/kloptops/), with
support from Cebion of [AmberELEC](https://amberelec.org) and Christian Haitian of
[ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian).
